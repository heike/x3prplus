## Goal

- We wish to determine whether two bullets were fired from the same gun barrel
- Striation patterns are unique to barrels and fairly stable
- Forensic Examiners shoot bullets from guns of suspects, compare it to bullet from crime scene

![](images/striations.jpg)

## James Hamby Study

- Ten consecutively rifled Ruger P-85 pistol barrels used to fire 20 "known" test bullets and 15 "unknown" bullets for comparison
- Sets of 35 bullets sent to 507 Forensic Examiners for examination
- 0 false positive identifications, 8 inconclusive results (out of 7605)

## Data Format

- 3D topographical images of each bullet
- x3p format, array of surface measurements at the micrometer level
- R package x3pr available for working with these images
- R package x3prplus is our additional functions to perform this analysis
- Each bullet is a set of 6 land-to-land scans

## A Quick Look

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot3D.x3p.file(read.x3p("images/Br1 Bullet 1-1.x3p"), 
                plot.type = "surface")
```

## Procedure

The basic procedure can be described as follows:

1. Extract a profile at a fixed bullet height
2. Identify and remove the grooves from that profile
3. Fit a loess regression to the remaining profile (called the signature)
4. Get the residuals from this regression
5. Identify peaks and valleys in residuals
6. Extract features from the residuals
7. Use these features in a random forest to predict matches

## Step One: Extract a Profile

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=3, warning=FALSE}
br111 <- get_crosscut("images/Br1 Bullet 1-1.x3p", x = 243.75)

qplot(y, value, data = br111) + theme_bw()
```

## Step Two: Remove Grooves

1. At a fixed height $x$ extract a bullet's profile (Figure~\ref{fig:loess_step1}, with $x = 243.75\mu m$).
2. For each $y$ value, smooth out any deviations occurring near the minima by twice applying a rolling average with a pre-set \emph{smoothing factor} $s$.
3. For each smoothed $y$ value, compute another rolling average using the same smoothing factor as above.
4. Determine the location of the peak of the left groove by finding the first doubly-smoothed value $y_i$ that is the maximum within its smoothing window. (Similar for valley of left groove).

## Step Two: Remove Grooves (Continued)

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=3, warning=FALSE}
br111.groove <- get_grooves(br111, smoothfactor = 35)
br111.groove
```

## Step Three: Fit Loess Regression

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=3, warning=FALSE}
br111.loess <- fit_loess(br111, br111.groove)
br111.loess$fitted
```

## Step Four: Get the Residuals

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=3, warning=FALSE}
br111.loess$resid
```

## Step Five: Peaks and Valleys

What defines a peak and a valley? That's a tough question.

There's a lot of noise in the residual plots. We can do some smoothing in a similar manner to how we did for detecting grooves.

## Step Five: Peaks and Valleys (Continued)

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=3, warning=FALSE}
br111.peaks <- get_peaks(br111.loess$data)
br111.peaks$plot
```

## Step Six: Extract Features

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

mypaths <- c("images/Br1 Bullet 1-1.x3p", "images/Br1 Bullet 2-3.x3p")
my_bullets <- lapply(mypaths, function(x) {
    result <- read.x3p(x)
    result[[3]] <- x
    names(result)[3] <- "path"
        
    return(result)
})
bullets_processed <- lapply(my_bullets, function(bul) {
    processBullets(bullet = bul, name = bul$path, x = 243.75)
})
names(bullets_processed) <- mypaths

bullets_smoothed <- bullets_processed %>% bind_rows %>% bulletSmooth

br111 <- filter(bullets_smoothed, bullet == mypaths[1])
br123 <- filter(bullets_smoothed, bullet == mypaths[2])
```

- Maximal number of CMS (consecutive matching striae), and, similarly, the number of consecutively non-matching striae (CNMS), 
- Number of matches and non-matches,
- Average difference $D$ between signatures, defined as the Euclidean vertical distance between surface measurements of aligned signatures.

## Slight Procedure Modifications

The basic procedure can be described as follows:

1. Extract a profile at a fixed bullet height
2. **Identify and remove the grooves from that profile**
3. Fit a loess regression to the remaining profile (called the signature)
4. Get the residuals from this regression
5. Identify peaks and valleys in residuals
6. **Extract features from the residuals**
7. Use these features in a random forest to predict matches
8. **Package algorithm in web application**

## Identifying Grooves (Easy)

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=5}
result <- get_grooves(get_crosscut("~/GitHub/imaging-paper/app/images/Hamby252_3DX3P1of2/Br1 Bullet 1-2.x3p"))
result$plot
```

## Identifying Grooves (Challenging)

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=5}
result2 <- get_grooves(get_crosscut("~/GitHub/imaging-paper/app/images/Hamby252_3DX3P1of2/Br1 Bullet 1-6.x3p"))
result2$plot
```

## Improvements Made - Crosscut location

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=2, echo=FALSE}
get_grooves(get_crosscut("~/GitHub/imaging-paper/app/images/Hamby252_3DX3P1of2/Br1 Bullet 1-4.x3p", x = 155))$plot
get_grooves(get_crosscut("~/GitHub/imaging-paper/app/images/Hamby252_3DX3P1of2/Br1 Bullet 1-4.x3p", x = 55))$plot
```

## Improvements Made - Mean Profile

```{r, fig.height=3, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
mybullet <- fortify_x3p(read.x3p("~/GitHub/imaging-paper/app/images/Hamby252_3DX3P1of2/Br1 Bullet 1-4.x3p"))
mean.bullet <- mybullet %>%
    group_by(y) %>%
    summarise(value = mean(value, na.rm = TRUE))
qplot(y, value, data = mean.bullet, geom = "line") + theme_bw()
```

## Reminder: List of Features

- Maximal number of CMS (consecutive matching striae), and, similarly, the number of consecutively non-matching striae (CNMS), 
- Number of matches and non-matches,
- Average difference $D$ between signatures, defined as the Euclidean vertical distance between surface measurements of aligned signatures.
\[
D^2 = \frac{1}{\text{\#}t}\sum_t \left[f(t) - g(t)\right]^2,
\]
- The sum $S$ of average absolute heights of matched extrema
- Cross Correlation Function (CCF)

## Improvement: Scaling Features

Scale each feature dependent on the length by the length of the signature

- CMS per micrometer
- Matches per micrometer
- ...
- Also include the length of the signature as a feature

## Future Work

- We are extremely limited by data here - Currently we've only assessed this algorithm on one particular set of 70 bullets
- There is likely an effect from the equipment used to scan the bullets, or the person performing the scan
- We need to assess the quality of the algorithm in case we don't have full bullet lands available, as is the case in many forensics applications
