\title{Identifying a reliable cross section}
\usage{
bulletCheckCrossCut(path, distance = 25, xlimits = c(50, 500),
  minccf = 0.9)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{path to an x3p file}

\item{distance}{positive numeric value indicating the distance between cross sections to use for a comparison}

\item{minccf}{minimal value of cross correlation to indicate a stable region}

\item{x}{vector of values to check for cross sections}
}
\description{
Should be changed: x should just indicate lower and upper limit. That is cleaner and should speed things up as well.
